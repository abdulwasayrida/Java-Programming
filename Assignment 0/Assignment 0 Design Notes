Design Notes 


Part 1: 
	1.	Declare variables for input. - num_TV, num_VCR, num_RC, num_CD, num_TR 
	2.	Import Scanner and prompt user for values for number of 
	3.	Declare constants for unit price (use double for proper formatting of money: 400, 220, 35.20, 300, 150
	4.	Declare variables for total price —TVP, VCRP, RCP, CDP, TRP
	5.	Declare variables for unit price — TPTV, TPVCR, TPRC, TPCD, TPTR 
	6.	Declare variables for subtotal, tax and total
	7.	Use Subtotal = addition of all Total Prices
	8.	Use Tax = 0.0825 + SubTotal
	9.	Total = tax + subtotal  
	10.	Format Table 

Part 2:
	1.	Import Scanner
	2.	Declare variables for input—temp1, and then prompt user for input
	3.	Declare variable Fahrenheit and use appropriate formula 
	4.	Print out the Fahrenheit value
	5.	Repeat steps 2-4 but with temp2 for input and output is Centigrade 
 
Since this program is not that complex, executing the program is very simple; just run the main source code provided.
