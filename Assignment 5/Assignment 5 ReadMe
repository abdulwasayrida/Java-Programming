ReadME:

For the following Lab Assignment, I created a program that performs a statistical
analysis of scores for a class of students. I created 2 packages—one for the Driver, and
one for the other classes. In the Driver package, I called the functions from the other
package (titled lab5) and used the print methods to print the analytical data.
In the package called lab5, I created 3 classes—one for Statistics, one for the Util
(reading the Test File), and one for the Student. In the Statistics class, I had methods to
find the high, low, and average scores as well as print methods. In the Util class, I
created a FileIO code to read the data with the student quiz grades. In the Student class,
I declared variables such as Student ID (SID) and an array to hold the scores. I also
included print methods to print out the information.
In the package called Driver, I created a class called Driver in which I imported the lab5
package and included a welcome message and a new Util object. I then populated the
student array with the test scores, and called the appropriate methods to find and print
the Highest scores, the Lowest scores, and the Average scores.

Comments:
For this assignment, the Driver class in the package Driver must be run. It is important to
note that the other package must be imported in order for the code to function smoothly.
Personally, I find it easier to import a whole package (as seen in my Util class) rather
than individual methods since it gives a better access to more resources.
